## Hi. This is apioframe-cores. This will be apioframe's alternative to Personality Cores.
I will not be accepting any PRs to this project so that I can know what the fuck is going on, and not have to wait for someone else to explain their shitcode and HORRENDOUS ai code.
Better to blame it on myself than a **certain** person. They know who they are anyways. (not you, qrmcat)
### Main Information Section
So, this is meant for turtles. I'll add a youtube video or something later on how they function and how to set their roaming area up later, as usual. (procrastination is fun)
### Installation
Just take the following files, put them in the turtle and then reboot it.
Should work after that. If not, it's a problem on your end.
(ping 'ktzukii' on the RCC discord if you *really* need help.)
<br>
startup.lua<br>
update.lua<br>
agent.lua<br>
bootstrap.lua<br>
__version__<br>
_data__<br>
LICENSE<br>
<br>
Any other files will be ignored.
<br>
Please note that the turtle will reboot after updating to make sure it has all files (since the files table has to be updated before it can actually do stuff)
